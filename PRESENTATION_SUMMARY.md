## 💡 **Core Innovation**

### **Problem:** 
Carbon credit markets lack transparency, blue carbon projects are hard to verify

### **Solution:** 
Automated scientific calculations + blockchain transparency + user-friendly interface

### **Impact:** 
Faster project approval, reduced costs, increased trust in carbon markets

---

## 🧮 **Carbon Credit Formula (Technical Demo)**

```
Net_Credits = (Soil_Carbon + Biomass_Carbon - Baseline - GHG_Emissions) × (1 - 20% uncertainty)

Where:
- Soil_Carbon = Bulk_Density × Depth × Carbon_% × 10,000
- Biomass_Carbon = (AGB + BGB) × 0.47 carbon fraction
- GHG_Emissions = CH₄_flux × 28 + N₂O_flux × 298
```

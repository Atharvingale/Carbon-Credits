# 🚀 Quick Fix Guide - Get Your Project Submissions Working

## 🎯 The Problem
Your database schema is set up, but you're missing:
1. The `admin_project_submissions` view that the admin dashboard needs
2. Proper RLS (Row Level Security) policies 
3. Admin role assignment
4. Triggers to sync data between tables

## 🔧 Step 1: Run Database Fixes

### In Supabase SQL Editor:
1. **Copy the entire contents** of `database_fixes.sql`
2. **Paste into Supabase SQL Editor**
3. **Execute the script**
4. **Check for any error messages**

This will:
- ✅ Create the missing `admin_project_submissions` view
- ✅ Fix RLS policies for proper data access
- ✅ Add triggers to sync data between `project_submissions` and `projects` tables
- ✅ Add ecosystem types to your `project_types` table

## 🔐 Step 2: Set Up Admin Role

### In Supabase SQL Editor:
1. **Copy the contents** of `setup_admin_role.sql`
2. **Replace `'your-email@domain.com'`** with your actual email address
3. **Execute the script**

This will:
- ✅ Grant admin role to your account
- ✅ Create a test project submission
- ✅ Verify everything is working

## 🧪 Step 3: Test the Flow

### Test Form Submission:
1. **Log in** to your app as a regular user
2. **Navigate** to project submission form (`/project-submission`)
3. **Fill out all fields** (make sure ecosystem type dropdown works)
4. **Submit** the form
5. **Check browser console** for success message

### Test Admin Dashboard:
1. **Log in** with your admin account
2. **Navigate** to admin dashboard
3. **Should see** the submitted projects
4. **Try** the "Calculate Credits" button

## 📊 Step 4: Understanding the Data Flow

Here's how it works:

```
NGO submits form → project_submissions table (status: pending)
                      ↓
Admin reviews → Updates status to 'approved'
                      ↓
Trigger fires → Automatically creates entry in projects table
                      ↓
Credits calculated → Updates both tables with calculation data
```

## 🔍 Step 5: Debugging

If it's still not working, check these:

### Check User Profile:
```sql
-- See if you have a profile
SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE email = 'your-email@domain.com';
```

### Check Submissions:
```sql
-- See if submissions exist
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM project_submissions;
SELECT * FROM project_submissions ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

### Check Admin View:
```sql
-- See if admin view works
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM admin_project_submissions;
```

### Check Your Role:
```sql
-- Verify you have admin role
SELECT role FROM profiles WHERE email = 'your-email@domain.com';
```

## 🚨 Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "Table/view doesn't exist"
**Solution:** Run `database_fixes.sql` script

### Issue 2: "Permission denied" 
**Solution:** Make sure you have admin role set properly

### Issue 3: "No data showing in admin dashboard"
**Solution:** 
1. Check if any submissions exist in `project_submissions` table
2. Verify your admin role
3. Check browser console for errors

### Issue 4: "Form submission fails"
**Solution:**
1. Make sure user is logged in
2. Check if user has a profile in `profiles` table
3. Look at browser console for specific error

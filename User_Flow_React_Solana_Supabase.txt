Here’s the cleaned-up **final text format** you can copy directly into your docs or project plan ✅:

---

# Early-Phase User Flow (Login + Wallet + Admin Minting)

## 1. Landing Page

* Visitor comes to the website.
* Sees description of the platform (Blue Carbon MRV registry).
* Options: **Sign Up** / **Log In**.

---

## 2. User Authentication (Supabase)

* **Sign Up**: User or Admin registers with email + password.
* **Log In**: Existing User or Admin signs in.
* Session established with **JWT token**.
* Role (User/Admin) determined from Supabase (role column in DB).

---

## 3. User Flow (After Login)

### 3.1 Connect Wallet

* User connects their **Solana wallet** (e.g., Phantom).
* Website fetches wallet address & SOL/SPL balances.

### 3.2 User Dashboard

* Displays:

  * Wallet address.
  * Token balance (carbon credits, if minted to wallet).
  * Transaction history with links to **Solana Explorer**.
* **No ability to buy/sell in this phase** → purely **read-only** for credits.

---

## 4. Admin Flow (After Login)

### 4.1 Admin Dashboard

* Admin sees:

  * Pending project submissions (from NGOs/communities).
  * Previously approved projects.
  * List of wallets linked to projects.

### 4.2 Verification & Minting

* Admin reviews project data (uploaded separately or via form).
* If project is valid → Approves it.
* Mints **SPL tokens** (carbon credits) on Solana.
* Assigns tokens directly to **NGO/community wallet address**.

### 4.3 Tracking & Reporting

* Admin can:

  * View credits issued per project.
  * Monitor total supply of tokens.
  * Track retired vs active credits (manual in early MVP).

---

## 5. Transaction Confirmation (Both Roles)

* Once admin mints credits:

  * Tokens appear in **user’s connected wallet**.
  * Dashboard updates to reflect balance.
  * Transaction signature + link to **Solana Explorer** shown.

---

## ✅ Summary Journey (MVP with Auth + Admin Control)

1. Visit site → Sign up/login (User or Admin).
2. **User**: Connect wallet → View balances & transactions.
3. **Admin**: Verify projects → Approve → Mint credits → Assign tokens.
4. **User**: Sees credits in wallet + on Solana Explorer.

Do you also want me to make a **separate section just showing “User Flow” and “Admin Flow” independently** (side-by-side), so it’s presentation-ready?

# 🚀 Final Database Setup Guide - Carbon Credits Project

## 📋 Overview
This guide will help you integrate the new project submission form and admin dashboard with your existing database schema.

## 🔧 Step 1: Run Database Migration

### Execute the Migration:
1. **Open your Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
3. **Copy the entire contents** of `complete_database_migration.sql`
4. **Paste and execute** the SQL

### What This Migration Does:
- ✅ **Adds missing columns** to your existing `projects` table
- ✅ **Creates `project_submissions` table** for form submissions
- ✅ **Sets up RLS policies** for security
- ✅ **Creates admin view** for dashboard
- ✅ **Adds performance indexes**
- ✅ **Creates automatic triggers** for data sync
- ✅ **Populates project types** for blue carbon projects

## 📊 Database Schema Changes

### New Columns Added to `projects` Table:
```sql
carbon_data JSONB                    -- Environmental parameters as JSON
ecosystem_type TEXT                  -- Type of coastal ecosystem
project_area DECIMAL                 -- Project area (compatible with existing 'area')
calculated_credits DECIMAL          -- Calculated carbon credits
calculation_data JSONB              -- Calculation details
calculation_timestamp TIMESTAMP     -- When calculation was performed
```

### New `project_submissions` Table:
```sql
id UUID PRIMARY KEY                  -- Unique submission ID
user_id UUID → profiles(id)         -- User who submitted
title, description, location TEXT   -- Project details
ecosystem_type TEXT                  -- Blue carbon ecosystem type
project_area DECIMAL                 -- Area in hectares
organization_name TEXT               -- Organization info
organization_email TEXT
contact_phone TEXT
carbon_data JSONB                    -- All environmental parameters
status TEXT                          -- pending, approved, rejected, etc.
calculated_credits DECIMAL          -- Calculated credits
project_id UUID → projects(id)      -- Link to main project (when approved)
created_at, updated_at TIMESTAMP    -- Timestamps
```

### New Admin View:
```sql
admin_project_submissions -- Combines submissions with user profiles
```

## 🛠️ Step 2: Update Your Admin Dashboard

The `AdminDashboardExample.jsx` component has been updated to work with your existing schema. It now:

- ✅ **Uses the `admin_project_submissions` view** for better data access
- ✅ **Handles your existing profile structure** correctly
- ✅ **Works with the carbon credit calculator**
- ✅ **Provides complete admin functionality**

## 🎯 Step 3: Test the Integration

### Test Form Submission:
1. **Navigate to your project submission form**
2. **Fill out all required fields** including:
   - Organization information
   - Project details with ecosystem type selection
   - All environmental/carbon parameters
3. **Submit the form**
4. **Check that data appears** in Supabase `project_submissions` table

### Test Admin Dashboard:
1. **Set up admin role** for your account:
   ```sql
   UPDATE profiles 
   SET role = 'admin' 
   WHERE email = 'your-email@domain.com';
   ```
2. **Access the admin dashboard**
3. **Verify you can see all submitted projects**
4. **Test the carbon credit calculator**

## 🔐 Step 4: Security Setup

### Grant Admin Role:
```sql
-- Replace with your actual admin email
UPDATE profiles 
SET role = 'admin' 
WHERE email = 'your-admin-email@domain.com';
```

### Verify RLS Policies:
```sql
-- Check that policies are active
SELECT tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'project_submissions';
```

## 🧪 Step 5: Test Data (Optional)

If you want to add test data for development:

```sql
-- Insert a sample submission (replace user_id with actual UUID)
INSERT INTO project_submissions (
    user_id,
    title,
    description,
    location,
    ecosystem_type,
    project_area,
    estimated_credits,
    organization_name,
    organization_email,
    carbon_data
) VALUES (
    (SELECT id FROM profiles WHERE email = 'your-test-user@domain.com'),
    'Test Mangrove Project',
    'Test mangrove restoration for development',
    'Test Location',
    'mangrove',
    100.0,
    1500,
    'Test Organization',
    'test@example.com',
    '{"bulk_density": 1.2, "depth": 1.0, "carbon_percent": 3.5, "agb_biomass": 150, "bgb_biomass": 75, "carbon_fraction": 0.47, "ch4_flux": 5.2, "n2o_flux": 0.8, "baseline_carbon_stock": 120, "uncertainty_deduction": 0.2}'
);
```

## 📋 Integration Workflow

### Form Submission → Admin Review → Project Creation:

1. **User submits form** → Data stored in `project_submissions`
2. **Admin reviews submission** → Updates status and adds notes
3. **Admin calculates credits** → Uses carbon credit calculator
4. **Admin approves** → Automatically creates entry in `projects` table
5. **Credits minted** → Integration with blockchain (your implementation)

### Database Flow:
```
project_submissions (status: pending)
         ↓ (admin review)
project_submissions (status: approved)
         ↓ (automatic trigger)
projects (status: approved) + project_submissions (project_id: set)
```

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Form Submission Errors:
- **Check authentication**: User must be logged in
- **Verify user exists** in `profiles` table
- **Check console** for JavaScript errors

### Admin Dashboard Issues:
- **Verify admin role**: `SELECT role FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid();`
- **Check view permissions**: Admin view should be accessible
- **Verify data exists**: Check if any submissions exist in the table

### Calculator Errors:
- **Ensure carbon_data is valid JSON**
- **Check all required fields** are present
- **Verify calculation utility** is imported correctly

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Supabase logs** in Dashboard → Logs
2. **Verify environment variables** are correct
3. **Test individual SQL queries** in SQL Editor
4. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors

## 🎉 Success!

Once everything is working:
- ✅ **Users can submit blue carbon projects** with complete environmental data
- ✅ **Admins can review and approve** submissions
- ✅ **Carbon credits are calculated** using scientific formulas
- ✅ **Projects flow automatically** from submissions to main projects table
- ✅ **Full audit trail** is maintained for all actions

Your Carbon Credits platform is now ready for production! 🌊🌱

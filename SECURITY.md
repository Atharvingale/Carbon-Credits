# Security Guidelines and Enhancements

## Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. Debug Code Removal

- ✅ Removed test/debug components and references
- ✅ Cleaned up development artifacts

### 2. Authentication & Authorization Security
- ✅ Enhanced ProtectedRoute with proper error handling
- ✅ Role-based access control for admin functions
- ✅ JWT token validation and refresh
- ✅ Session management improvements

### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization
- ✅ Created comprehensive input sanitization utilities (`utils/sanitization.js`)
- ✅ XSS protection for user inputs
- ✅ Wallet address validation and sanitization
- ✅ Project data sanitization
- ✅ User profile data sanitization

### 4. API Security Enhancements
- ✅ Rate limiting implemented on server
- ✅ Input validation middleware
- ✅ CORS and security headers configured
- ✅ Request tracing and logging
- ✅ Error handling with sanitized responses

### 5. UI Security Improvements
- ✅ Replaced `alert()` dialogs with proper UI components
- ✅ Removed direct DOM manipulation
- ✅ Enhanced error messaging
- ✅ Rate limiting on client-side operations

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### Environment Variables
- Validate all environment variables on startup
- Use HTTPS-only URLs for Supabase connections
- Implement basic format validation for API keys

### Database Security
- Use Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Sanitize all user inputs before database operations
- Validate data types and constraints
- Use parameterized queries (handled by Supabase client)

### Blockchain Security
- Validate all wallet addresses before transactions
- Implement admin-only minting with multi-layer verification
- Use secure key storage for blockchain operations
- Audit trail for all blockchain transactions

### Client-Side Security
- XSS protection through input sanitization
- CSRF protection via proper headers
- Content Security Policy recommendations
- Rate limiting for user actions

## Security Recommendations for Deployment

### 1. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Production environment variables
NODE_ENV=production
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
REACT_APP_WALLET_API_URL=https://api.yourapp.com

# Server environment variables
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
SOLANA_PAYER_SECRET=your-base58-private-key
SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
SOLANA_CLUSTER=mainnet-beta
CORS_ORIGIN=https://yourapp.com
LOG_LEVEL=error
```

### 2. Database Security (Supabase)
- Enable Row Level Security on all tables
- Create proper policies for user access
- Use service role key only on server-side
- Regular security audits and updates

### 3. Server Security
- Use HTTPS for all connections
- Implement proper SSL/TLS configuration
- Use reverse proxy (nginx) for additional security
- Regular security updates and patches

### 4. Monitoring and Logging
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Monitor for suspicious activities
- Set up alerts for security events
- Regular security audits

## Code Security Guidelines

### Input Handling
```javascript
// Always sanitize user inputs
import { sanitizeText, sanitizeProjectData } from '../utils/sanitization';

const handleUserInput = (input) => {
  const sanitized = sanitizeText(input);
  // Use sanitized input for processing
};
```

### Wallet Operations
```javascript
// Always validate wallet addresses
import { sanitizeWalletAddress } from '../utils/sanitization';

const handleWalletAddress = (address) => {
  const result = sanitizeWalletAddress(address);
  if (!result.valid) {
    throw new Error(result.error);
  }
  return result.sanitized;
};
```

### API Calls
```javascript
// Always include proper error handling
try {
  const response = await apiCall();
  // Handle success
} catch (error) {
  // Never expose internal errors to users
  showUserFriendlyError('Operation failed. Please try again.');
  // Log detailed error for debugging
  logError(error);
}
```

## Security Testing Checklist

### Authentication Testing
- [ ] Test with expired tokens
- [ ] Test role-based access controls
- [ ] Test session management
- [ ] Test logout functionality

### Input Validation Testing
- [ ] Test XSS payloads in all inputs
- [ ] Test SQL injection attempts
- [ ] Test malformed data inputs
- [ ] Test boundary conditions

### API Security Testing
- [ ] Test rate limiting
- [ ] Test unauthorized access attempts
- [ ] Test malformed requests
- [ ] Test CORS configuration

### Blockchain Security Testing
- [ ] Test with invalid wallet addresses
- [ ] Test unauthorized minting attempts
- [ ] Test transaction validation
- [ ] Test key security

## Security Incident Response

### 1. Detection
- Monitor logs for suspicious activities
- Set up alerts for security events
- Regular security audits

### 2. Response
- Immediate containment of threats
- Assessment of impact
- Communication plan
- Recovery procedures

### 3. Prevention
- Regular security updates
- Code reviews with security focus
- Penetration testing
- Security training for developers

## Compliance and Auditing

### Data Protection

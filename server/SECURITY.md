# Security Information

## Current Security Status

### Known Vulnerabilities

As of 2025-01-18, there are **3 high severity vulnerabilities** in the dependency chain:

```
bigint-buffer  *
Severity: high
bigint-buffer Vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via toBigIntLE() Function
├── @solana/buffer-layout-utils (depends on vulnerable bigint-buffer)
└── @solana/spl-token >=0.2.0-alpha.0 (depends on vulnerable buffer-layout-utils)
```

### Root Cause

The vulnerabilities are in the `bigint-buffer` package, which is a dependency of `@solana/buffer-layout-utils`, which in turn is used by `@solana/spl-token@0.4.14`.

### Risk Assessment

**Impact**: Buffer overflow vulnerability in bigint-buffer's `toBigIntLE()` function
**Affected Components**: Solana SPL token operations (minting functionality)
**Exploitation Vector**: Malicious input during token operations

### Mitigation Status

✅ **Server-Side Mitigations in Place:**
- Input validation on all token amounts and addresses
- Rate limiting on minting operations (5 requests/minute)
- Admin-only access to minting endpoints
- Request size limits (10MB max)
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Solana address format validation

✅ **Network-Level Protections:**
- CORS restrictions
- Security headers (Helmet.js)
- Authentication requirements
- Request tracing for forensics

### Available Fixes

#### Option 1: Breaking Change Fix (Use with caution)
```bash
npm audit fix --force
```
⚠️ **Warning**: This will downgrade `@solana/spl-token` from 0.4.14 to 0.1.8, which may break existing functionality.

#### Option 2: Alternative Solana Libraries
Consider migrating to:
- `@solana/spl-token` v0.3.x (if compatible)
- Alternative Solana libraries
- Custom token implementation

#### Option 3: Wait for Upstream Fix
Monitor for updates to `@solana/spl-token` that address the `bigint-buffer` vulnerability.

### Monitoring

The following should be monitored for security updates:
- `@solana/spl-token` releases
- `bigint-buffer` security advisories
- Solana ecosystem security bulletins

### Recommended Actions

1. **For Development**: Continue with current setup but monitor for updates
2. **For Production**: 
   - Implement additional input sanitization
   - Consider running vulnerability scanning
   - Monitor for suspicious token operations
   - Keep logs for forensic analysis

### Security Best Practices

1. **Environment Isolation**
   - Use separate development/production environments
   - Limit network access to essential services only
   - Regular security audits

2. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - All token operations are logged with request IDs
   - Failed authentication attempts are tracked
   - Rate limiting violations are monitored

3. **Access Control**
   - Token minting requires admin role
   - JWT authentication on all sensitive endpoints
   - Wallet address validation before operations

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover additional security vulnerabilities:

1. **DO NOT** create public GitHub issues
2. Contact the development team privately
3. Provide detailed reproduction steps
4. Include affected versions and configurations

## Updates

This document will be updated as:
- New vulnerabilities are discovered
- Fixes become available
- Mitigations are implemented
